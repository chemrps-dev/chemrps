ChemRPS (Chemical Registration & Publishing System)
===================================================

Overview
--------

.. image:: docs/images/chemrps_logo_blue.jpg 

**ChemRPS** is a free Docker based system that allows you 
to load and search SDFiles by structure on your corporate website or local computer.

The system comes with a preconfigured RDKit enabled PostGresql database, a search engine (API) and 
a preconfigured webserver with register/search web pages including structure editor (Ketcher from EPAM).
It also contains a program that allows you to bulk load SDFiles.

ChemRPS is intended to be used by small or medium sized companies looking for an easy way to make
their chemical structures searchable on the Internet, without the need to invest a lot of money
for license fees or programming services.


Because of the easy deployment ChemRPS can also be used by individuals looking for an 'out-of-the-box'
solution that allows them to make structures contained in SDFiles searchable via Substructure and/or
Structure similarity search.
